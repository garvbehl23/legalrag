## Citation Ambiguity

### Observation
LEXAR occasionally attaches multiple supporting citations alongside a
primary section.

### Example
Query: "What is the punishment for murder under IPC?"
Citations: IPC §302 (Primary), IPC §303, IPC §304 (Supporting)

### Analysis
Legal reasoning often requires contextual provisions. LEXAR intentionally
surfaces supporting sections to preserve legal completeness, at the cost
of minimal citation verbosity.
